# Gatsby Theme Celloworld Example

A usage of
[gatsby-theme-celloworld](https://github.com/alfieqashwa/gatsby-theme-celloworld)
that does nothing but use the theme. As a result you will see `Error: Missing resources for /` when navigating to `localhost:8000`. To get
rid of that, create a page in `src/pages/index.js`.
